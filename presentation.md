## What is DSCOVR?

The _Deep Space Climate Observatory_, abbreviated as DSCOVR, provides realtime solar wind observations so that forecasters can provide early warnings about geomagnetic storms. DSCOVER's ultimate purpose is to discover incoming geomagnetic storms down to 15 minutes before these solar storms reach Earth and interrupt our electronics.
